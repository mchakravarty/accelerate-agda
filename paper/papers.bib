                 penalty of being too inefficient. Inverse computation and neighborhood
                 analysis are used to demonstrate the computational feasibility of the
                 approach. Equivalence transformers are shown to fulfill the requirements
                 of semantics modifiers. Finally, projections are given that allow the

                 Omniware: a safe, efficient, and language-independent
                 system for executing mobile program modules. Previous
                 approaches to implementing mobile code rely on either
                 language semantics or abstract machine interpretation
                 to enforce safety. In the former case, the mobile code
                 system sacrifices universality to gain safety by
                 dictating a particular source language or type system.
                 In the latter case, the mobile code system sacrifices
                 performance to gain safety through abstract machine
                 interpretation. Omniware uses software fault isolation,
                 a technology developed to provide safe extension code
                 for databases and operating systems, to achieve a
                 unique combination of language-independence and
                 excellent performance. Software fault isolation uses
                 only the semantics of the underlying processor to
                 determine whether a mobile code module can corrupt its
                 execution environment. This separation of programming
                 language implementation from program module safety
                 enables our mobile code system to use a radically
                 simplified virtual machine as its basis for
                 portability. We measured the performance of Omniware
                 using a suite of four SPEC92 programs on the Pentium,
                 PowerPC, Mips, and Sparc processor architectures.
                 Including the overhead for enforcing safety on all four
                 processors, OmniVM executed the benchmark programs
                 within 21\% as fast as the optimized, unsafe code
                 produced by the vendor-supplied compiler.",

                 implementation demonstrates the value of OO-specific
                 optimization for C++\@. Despite some limitations of our
                 system, and despite the low frequency of virtual
                 function calls in some of the programs, optimization
                 improves the performance of a suite of large C++
                 applications totalling over 90,000~lines of code by a
                 median of~18\% over the original programs and reduces
                 the number of virtual function calls by a median factor
                 of five. For more call-intensive versions of the same
                 programs, performance improved by a median of~26\% and
                 the number of virtual calls dropped by a factor~17.5\@.
                 Our measurements indicate that inlining barely
                 increases code sizes, and that for most programs, the
                 instruction cache miss ratio does not increase
                 significantly.",

                 lambda calculus and the actual behavior of
                 implementations is a major obstacle for compiler
                 writers. They cannot explain the behavior of their
                 evaluator in terms of source level syntax, and they
                 cannot easily compare distinct implementations of
                 different lazy strategies. In this paper we derive an
                 equational characterization of call-by-need and prove
                 it correct with respect to the original lambda
                 calculus. The theory is a strictly smaller theory than
                 the lambda calculus. Immediate applications of the
                 theory concern the correctness proofs of a number of
                 implementation strategies, \emph{e.g.}, the
                 call-by-need continuation passing transformation and

  abstract =     "Strongly-typed languages present programmers with
                 compile-time feedback about the type correctness of
                 programs. Errors during polymorphic type checking take
                 the form of a unification failure for two types.
                 Finding the source of the type error in the code is
                 often difficult because the error may occur far from
                 the spot where the inconsistency is detected. As
                 functional languages use more and more complex type
                 systems, the difficulty of interpreting and locating
                 these errors will increase. To locate the source of
                 type errors the programmer must unravel the long chain
                 of deductions and type instantiations made during type
                 reconstruction. This paper describes an approach that
                 maintains the deductive steps of type inference and the
                 reasons for type instantiations. The approach could be
                 used in an interactive system to guide the programmer
                 to the source of a type error or to explain why the
                 compiler assigned a particular type to an expression.",

              There is a style of functional programming
              which focuses attention on a small collection of
              powerful higher-order functions that capture
              common patterns of computation. The idea is to
              try and express programs in terms of the
              composition of particular instances of these
              useful functions. Explicit use of recursion is
              therefore avoided, except as a last resort.

              A similar, indeed dual, style can be advocated
              when it comes to program proof. The idea here is
              to try and conduct proofs through equational reasoning
              that exploits the algebraic properties of the
              collection of higher-order functions. Explicit use
              of induction is therefore avoided.

                 generator generator by presenting a program generator
                 generator for a skeletal language, and we argue that it
                 is not more difficult to use the direct approach than
                 the indirect approach. Moreover, we report on some
                 promising experiments made with a prototype

To ensure that the client is presented with the newest versions of such documents it is customary to disable client caching causing a seemingly inevitable performance penalty. In the <bigwig> system, dynamic HTML documents are composed of higher-order templates that are plugged together to construct complete documents. We show how to exploit this feature to provide an automatic fine-grained caching of document templates, based on the service source code. A <bigwig> service transmits not the full HTML document but instead a compact {JavaScript} recipe for a client-side construction of the document based on a static collection of fragments that can be cached by the browser in the usual manner. We compare our approach with related techniques and demonstrate on a number of realistic benchmarks that the size of the transmitted data and the latency may be reduced significantly.}

  abstract =     "System $F$ is a well-known typed $\lambda$-calculus
                 with polymorphic types, which provides a basis for
                 polymorphic programming languages. We study an
                 extension of $F$, called $F_{<:}$ (pronounced {\em
                 ef-sub\/}), that combines parametric polymorphism with
                 subtyping. The main focus of the paper is the
                 equational theory of $F_{<:}$, which is related to PER
                 models and the notion of parametricity. We study some
                 categorical properties of the theory when restricted to
                 closed terms, including interesting categorical
                 isomorphisms. We also investigate proof-theoretical
                 properties, such as the conservativity of typing
                 judgments with respect to $F$. We demonstrate by a set
                 of examples how a range of constructs may be encoded in
                 $F_{<:}$. These include record operations and subtyping
                 hierarchies that are related to features of
                 object-oriented languages.",

  abstract =	"We present and analyze the semantics and static type
		 system for BeCecil, a theoretical (core) language with
		 multimethods. BeCecil is a simple and orthogonal
		 version of object-oriented languages like Cecil, CLOS,
		 and Dylan. BeCecil has a new, simple mechanism for
		 information hiding, which allows subclassing and yet
		 can preserve representation invariants. BeCecil is also
		 block-structured; within a block, one can extend a
		 generic function with new multimethods, which may come
		 from other generic functions. The inheritance
		 relationships of objects may be extended in any block,
		 and are statically scoped. The type system separates
		 classes from types, and inheritance from subtyping.
		 Subtype relationships are also extensible and
		 statically scoped. These features combine to make
		 BeCecil unusually expressive, while still allowing
		 static typechecking.",

                 order to improve the BTA and hence the partial

                 binding time decisions and may be extensible to allow
                 for programmer directed bind times. Residual code is
                 given in a format similar to the original so that a
                 programmer may more easily determine where the dynamic
                 parts of the code remain.",

                 like inlining often discard such information; using
                 interprocedural data-flow information as a basis for
                 optimization can have the same effect.\par In the
                 course of a study on inline substitution with
                 commercial FORTRAN compilers, we encountered unexpected
                 performance problems in one of the programs. This paper
                 describes the specific problem that we encountered,
                 explores its origins, and examines the ability of
                 several analytical techniques to help the compiler

  ABSTRACT = {This work sets the formal bases for building tools
                 that help retrieve classes in object-oriented
                 libraries. In such systems, the user provides a query,
                 formulated as a set of class interfaces. The tool
                 returns classes in the library that can be used to
                 implement the user's request and automatically builds
                 the required glue code. We propose subtyping of
                 recursive types in the presence of associative and
                 commutative products---that is, subtyping modulo a
                 restricted form of type isomorphisms---as a model of
                 the relation that exists between the user's query and
                 the tool's answers. We show that this relation is a
                 composition of the standard subtyping relation with
                 equality up to associativity and commutativity of
                 products and we present an efficient decision algorithm
                 for it. We also provide an automatic way of
                 constructing coercions between related types.}

  abstract = 	 {Goal-directed evaluation, as embodied in Icon and Snobol, is
built on the notions of backtracking and of generating
successive results, and therefore it has always been something
of a challenge to specify and implement.  In this article, we
address this challenge using computational monads and partial
evaluation.

We consider a subset of Icon and we specify it with a monadic
semantics and a list monad.  We then consider a spectrum of
monads that also fit the bill, and we relate them to each
other.  For example, we derive a continuation monad as a Church
encoding of the list monad.  The resulting semantics coincides
with Gudeman's continuation semantics of Icon.

We then compile Icon programs by specializing their interpreter
(i.e., by using the first Futamura projection), using
type-directed partial evaluation.  Through various back ends,
including a run-time code generator, we generate ML code, C
code, and OCaml byte code.  Binding-time analysis and partial
evaluation of the continuation-based interpreter automatically
give rise to C programs that coincide with the result of
Proebsting's optimized compiler.

                 procedures in dynamically-typed languages, or, in
                 general, any kind of entry action (e.g., unboxing). For
                 some call sites some of these entry actions are
                 unnecessary (e.g., for typechecks, because the type is
                 known). The paper tries to exploit this for
                 optimization by having several entry points for the
                 procedure, and every call site calling an entry point
                 that precedes all necessary (and possibly some
                 unnecessary) entry actions. The entry actions can be
                 ordered to minimize executing unnecessary entry
                 actions; this problem is NP-complete. Another approach
                 to dealing with the problem is to inline some entry
                 actions into the call sites; the paper claims that this
                 apprach leads to significant code bloat in a number of
                 application programs. The paper introduces a greedy
                 algorithm for ordering the entry actions and performing
                 bounded inlining of entry actions; this algorithm
                 performs optimally for all presented benchmarks, but
                 the paper does not tell what bound on code growth was
                 used (except maybe in footnote 3; it appears to imply
                 that the implementation of the algorithm copies just
                 enough to avoid all unnecessary entry actions; then the
                 optimiality is trivial, but what about code growth (no
                 data presented for that)?). The improvements in
                 execution time are 12\%--45\%.",

  abstract =     "We discuss aspects of inlining of virtual method
                 invocations. First, we introduce a new method test to
                 guard inlinings of such invocations, with a different
                 set of tradeoffs from the class-equality tests proposed
                 previously in the literature. Second, we consider the
                 problem of inlining virtual methods directly, with no
                 guarding test, in dynamic languages such as Self or the
                 {Java} (TM) programming language, whose semantics
                 prohibit a static identification of the complete set of
                 modules that comprise a program. In non-dynamic
                 languages, a whole-program analysis might prove the
                 correctness of a direct virtual inlining. In dynamic
                 languages, however, such analyses can be invalidated by
                 later class loading, and must therefore be treated as
                 assumptions whose later violation must cause
                 recompilation. In the past, such systems have required
                 an on-stack replacement mechanism to update
                 currently-executing invocations of methods containing
                 invalidated inlinings. This paper presents analyses
                 that allow some virtual calls to be inlined directly,
                 while ensuring that invocations in progress may
                 complete safely even if class loading invalidates the
                 inlining for future invocations. This provides the
                 benefits of direct inlining without the need for
                 on-stack replacement, which can be complicated and
                 require space-consuming data structures.",

  the traditional one; besides compositionality, it automatically verifies the

  abstract =     "Set-Based Analysis is an efficient and accurate
                 program analysis for higher-order languages. It
                 exploits an intuitive notion of approximation that
                 treats program variables as sets of values. We present
                 a new derivation of set-based analysis, based on a
                 reduction semantics, that substantially simplifies
                 previous formulations. Most importantly, the derivation
                 easily extends from a functional core language to
                 include imperative features such as assignments and
                 first-class continuations, and supports the first
                 correctness proof of set-based analysis for these
                 imperative features. The paper includes an
                 implementation of the derived analysis for a
                 Scheme-like language, and describes a soft-typing
                 algorithm that eliminates type-checks based on the
                 information produced by the analysis.",

  abstract =     {The Fraenkel-Mostowski permutation model of set theory with atoms
  (\emph{FM-sets}) can serve as the semantic basis of meta-logics for
  specifying and reasoning about formal systems involving name
  binding, $\alpha$-conversion, capture avoiding substitution, and so
  on.  We show that in FM-set theory one can express statements
  quantifying over `fresh' names and we use this to give a novel
  set-theoretic interpretation of name abstraction.  Inductively
  defined FM-sets involving this name-abstraction set former (together
  with cartesian product and disjoint union) can correctly encode
  object-level syntax modulo $\alpha$-conversion.  In this way, the
  standard theory of algebraic data types can be extended to encompass
  signatures involving binding operators.  In particular, there is an
  associated notion of structural recursion for defining
  syntax-manipulating functions (such as capture avoiding
  substitution, set of free variables, etc) and a notion of
  proof by structural induction, both of which remain pleasingly close
  to informal practice.}

demonstrate the

partial evaluator
                  for Fortran that we developed. Results for five

  abstract = {It was known as long ago as 1971 in Japan and Russia
                  that the program transformation principle called
                  \emph{partial evaluation} or \emph{program
                  specialization} has intimate connections with
                  compiling. In particular a program specialzer can be
                  used to compile, given as input data an
                  interpretative definition of a programming
                  language. Further, a program specializer can
                  generate a compiler and even a compiler
                  generator---provided it is self-applicable. The
                  purpose of this paper is to show by a concrete
                  example that certain rather simple techniques are
                  sufficient to construct a fully automatic and
                  nontrivial program specializer for a simple
                  imperative language. Further, the specializer is
                  self-applicable, with the consequence that it can
                  both compile and generate stand-alone compilers.}

                 so that an attacker may find it easier to break the
                 random number generator than the security system it is
                 used with. This paper provides a comprehensive guide to
                 designing and implementing a practically strong random
                 data accumulator and generator which requires no
                 specialised hardware or access to privileged system
                 services. The performance of the generator on a variety
                 of systems is analysed, and measures which can make
                 recovery of the accumulator/generator state information
                 more difficult for an attacker are presented. The
                 result is an easy-to-use random number generator which
                 should be suitable even for demanding cryptographic
                 applications.",

We present a new approach that identifies the location of a type error as a set of program points (a type error slice). On the one hand, type error slices contain enough program points to permit an independent explanation of a type error (``completeness''). On the other hand, they contain only program points that are necessary for such an explanation (``minimality''). We describe algorithms for finding type error slices for implicitly typed higher-order languages like Standard ML. }

                 environment. It is particularly intended for supporting
                 the open-ended, incremental development style often
                 preferred by non-specialist users (engineers,
                 scientists, analysts, etc.) in which successive steps
                 of program development are motivated and informed by
                 results so far obtained. In Vital, a Haskell module may
                 be associated with a worksheet on which its
                 declarations and expressions may be located and their
                 values graphically displayed. The form such displays
                 take is determined by a type-indexed stylesheet. The
                 values may be unbounded in extent and are lazily
                 evaluated to the required extent as the user moves the
                 viewport around the worksheet. The environment embodies
                 the principles of direct manipulation. In particular,
                 it allows declarations to be edited by mouse gestures
                 on the graphical representation of their values. For
                 example, a user might create a data structure (perhaps
                 a triangular array or a tree) by evaluating a function
                 and then copy-and-paste values into its elements. All
                 such changes are immediately reflected in the Haskell
                 source code and hence in the values of any dependent
                 declarations. ... a Java application ... -

	We show how the features of modern integrated functional logic
	programming languages can be exploited to implement graphical user
	interfaces (GUIs) in a high-level declarative style.  For this
	purpose, we have developed a GUI library in Curry, a multi-paradigm
	language amalgamating functional, logic, and concurrent programming
	principles.  The functional features of Curry are exploited to define
	the graphical structure of an interface and to implement new graphical
	abstractions, and the logic features of Curry are used to specify the
	logical dependencies of an interface.  Moreover, the concurrent and
	distributed features of Curry support the easy implementation of GUIs
	to distributed systems.

  abstract = 	 {We propose a new approach to program web services. Although we base our approach on the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) to ensure wide applicability, we avoid many
of the drawbacks and pitfalls of traditional CGI programming by providing an additional abstraction layer implemented in the multi-paradigm declarative language Curry.
For instance, the syntactical details of HTML and passing values with CGI are hidden by a wrapper that executes abstract HTML forms by translating them into concrete
HTML code. This leads to a high-level approach to server side web service programming where notions like event handlers, state variables and control of interactions are
available. Thanks to the use of a functional logic language, we can structure our approach as an embedded domain specific language where the functional and logic
programming features of the host language are exploited to abstract from details and frequent errors in standard CGI programming.

abstract = {
Assertions or contracts are an important technique to improve the
quality of software.  Thus, assertions are also desirable for
functional logic programming.  Unfortunately, there is no
established meaning of assertions in languages with a demand-driven
evaluation strategy.  Strict assertions are immediately checked but
may influence the behavior of programs.  Lazy assertions do not
modify the behavior but may not be faithful since some assertions
might not be checked at all.  This paper proposes an intermediate
approach where the user can choose between lazy or faithful
assertions.  In order to avoid disadvantages of faithful assertions,
we propose to delay them until an explicit point where faith is
required, e.g., at the end of the program execution or before I/O
actions.  We describe a prototypical implementation of this
idea in the functional logic language Curry.

  abstract =     "It is common practice to specify textual patterns by
                 means of a set of regular expressions and to transform
                 this set into a finite automaton to be used for the
                 scanning of input strings. In many applications, the
                 cost of this preprocessing phase can be amortized over
                 many uses of the constructed automaton. In this paper
                 new techniques for lazy and incremental scanner
                 generation are presented. The lazy technique postpones
                 the construction of parts of the automaton until they
                 are really needed during the scanning of input. The
                 incremental technique allows modifications to the
                 original set of regular expressions to be made and
                 reuses major parts of the previous automaton. This is
                 interesting in applications such as environments for
                 the interactive development of language definitions in
                 which modifications to the definition of lexical syntax
                 and the uses of the generated scanners alternate
                 frequently.",

                 greedy} manner in the sense that a program must be
                 generated in its entirety before it can be used. If
                 generation time is scarce, or if the input to the
                 generator is subject to modification, it may be better
                 to be more cautious and to generate only those parts of
                 the program that are indispensable for processing the
                 particular data at hand. We call this {\em lazy program
                 generation}. Another, closely related strategy is {\em
                 incremental program generation}. When its input is
                 modified, an incremental generator will try to make a
                 corresponding modification in its output rather than
                 generate a completely new program. It may be
                 advantageous to use a combination of both strategies in
                 program generators that have to operate in a highly

                 recursive procedures is significantly more complex than
                 their partial correctness. Past methods of proving
                 termination have suffered from being rigid, not
                 general, non-intuitive, and ad hoc in structure, not
                 suitable for mechanization. We have devised a new
                 method for proving termination and mechanized it within
                 an automatic tool called a Verification Condition
                 Generator. This tool analyzes not only the program's
                 syntax but also, uniquely, its procedure call graph, to
                 produce verification conditions sufficient to ensure
                 the program's total correctness. Diversion verification
                 conditions reduce the labor involved in proving
                 termination from infinite to finite. The VCG tool has
                 itself been deeply embedded and proven sound within the
                 HOL theorem prover with respect to the underlying
                 structural operational semantics. Now proofs of total
                 correctness of individual programs may be significantly
                 automated with complete security.",

  abstract =     "This paper presents a formal system based on the
                 notion of objects and asynchronous communication. Built
                 on Milner's work on $\pi$-calculus, the communication
                 primitive of the formal system is purely based on
                 asynchronous communication, which makes it unique among
                 various concurrency formalisms. Computationally this
                 results in a consistent reduction of Milner's calculus,
                 while retaining the same expressive power. Seen
                 semantically, asynchronous communication induces
                 a surprisingly different framework where bisimulation
                 is strictly more general than its synchronous
                 counterpart. This paper shows basic construction of the
                 formal system along with several illustrative
                 examples.",

                 a programming language can be given in terms of
                 transformations on a semantic environment. It is
                 worthwhile, therefore, to consider the implications of
                 incorporating environments as bona fide data objects in
                 a programming system.\par

                 In this article, we propose a treatment of environments
                 and the mechanism by which they are reified and
                 manipulated, that addresses these concerns. The
                 language described below (Rascal) permits environments
                 to be reified into data structures, and data structures
                 to be reflected into environments, but gives users
                 great flexibility to constrain the extent and scope of
                 these processes. We argue that the techniques and
                 operators developed define a cohesive basis for
                 building large-scale modular systems using reflective
                 programming techniques.",

discipline: exactly the same terms are typable in each system. An immediate consequence is that typability in the rank 2 intersection
system is DEXPTIME-complete. We introduce a rank 2 system combining intersections and polymorphism, and prove that it types
exactly the same terms as the other rank 2 systems. The combined system suggests a new rule for typing recursive definitions. The result
is a rank 2 type system with decidable type inference that can type some interesting examples of polymorphic recursion. Finally, we
discuss some applications of the type system in data representation optimizations such as unboxing and overloading.

Keywords: Rank 2 types, intersection types, polymorphic recursion, boxing/unboxing, overloading. }

  abstract =     "Module systems are a powerful, practical tool for
                 managing the complexity of large software systems.
                 Previous attempts to formulate a type-theoretic
                 foundation for modular programming have been based on
                 existential, dependent, or manifest types. These
                 approaches can be distinguished by their use of
                 different quantifiers to package the operations that a
                 module exports together with appropriate implementation
                 types. In each case, the underlying type theory is
                 simple and elegant, but significant and sometimes
                 complex extensions are needed to account for features
                 that are important in practical systems, such as
                 separate compilation and propagation of type
                 information between modules. This paper presents a
                 simple type-theoretic framework for modular programming
                 using parameterized signatures. The use of quantifiers
                 is treated as a necessary, but independent concern.
                 Using familiar concepts of polymorphism, the resulting
                 module system is easy to understand and admits true
                 separate compilati...",

                 be used to effect program transformation. This talk
                 shows that this technique, augmented by a preliminary
                 abstract interpretation, can yield, among many other
                 transformations: $\bullet$ Safe, efficient execution of
                 programs in an unsafe language, and $\bullet$ A change
                 in program style, from one list representation to
                 another. Further, partial evaluation can be viewed as
                 an on-line polyvariant abstract interpretation,
                 augmented by code generation. This view generalizes
                 conventional projection-based partial evaluation in the
                 direction of Turchin's supercompilation.",

                 specialization and information which is incidental. For
                 example, specializing {\tt (number? 1)} to {\tt true}
                 relies on the fact that 1 is a number, it does not rely
                 on the fact that the number has the value 1. The idea
                 in the paper is to maintain a context sensitive domain
                 of specialization which retains the information
                 actually used in the specialization. New
                 specializations are only made when the requirements do

  abstract =     "Security of mobile code is a major issue in today's
                 global computing environment. When you download a
                 program from an untrusted source, how can you be sure
                 it will not do something undesirable? In this paper I
                 will discuss a particular approach to this problem
                 called language-based security. In this approach,
                 security information is derived from a program written
                 in a high-level language during the compilation process
                 and is included in the compiled object. This extra
                 security information can take the form of a formal
                 proof, a type annotation, or some other form of
                 certificate or annotation. It can be downloaded along
                 with the object code and automatically verified before
                 running the code locally, giving some assurance against
                 certain types of failure or unauthorized activity. The
                 verifier must be trusted, but the compiler, code, and
                 certificate need not be. Java bytecode verification is
                 an example of this approach. I will give an overview of
                 some recent work in this area, including a particular
                 effort in which we are trying to make the production of
                 certificates and the verification as efficient and
                 invisible as possible.",

                 clearcut separation between computation and
                 communication and a formal definition of the
                 interactions between individual components. We present
                 a formalism for the definition of software
                 architectures in terms of graphs. Nodes represent the
                 individual agents and edges define their
                 interconnection. Individual agents can communicate only
                 along the links specified by the architecture. The
                 dynamic evolution of an architecture is defined
                 independently by a ``coordinator.'' An architecture
                 style is a class of architectures specified by a graph
                 grammar. The class characterizes a set of architectures
                 sharing a common communication pattern. The rules of
                 the coordinator are statically checked to ensure that
                 they preserve the constraints imposed by the
                 architecture style.",

  summary =      {Recall the ``size-change principle'' for program
                 termination: An infinite computation is impossible, if
                 it would give rise to an infinite sequence of size
                 decreases for some data values. For an actual analysis,
                 ``size-change graphs'' are used to capture data size
                 changes in possible program state transitions. A graph
                 sequence that respects program control flow is called a
                 ``multipath.'' Multipaths describe possible state
                 transition sequences. To show that such sequences are
                 finite, it is sufficient that the graphs satisfy
                 ``size-change termination'' (SCT): Every infinite
                 multipath has infinite descent, according to the arcs
                 of the graphs. This is an application of the
                 size-change principle. SCT is decidable, but complete
                 for PSPACE. In this paper, we explore efficient
                 approximations that are sufficiently precise in
                 practice. For size-change graphs that can loop (i.e.,
                 they give rise to an infinite multipath), and that
                 satisfy SCT, it is usually easy to identify among them
                 an ``anchor''-- some graph whose infinite occurrence
                 in a multipath causes infinite descent. The SCT
                 approximations are based on finding and eliminating
                 anchors as far as possible. If the remaining graphs
                 cannot loop, then SCT is established. An efficient
                 method is proposed to find anchors among ``fan-in
                 free'' graphs, as such graphs occur commonly in
                 practice. This leads to a worst-case quadratic-time
                 approximation of SCT. An extension of the method
                 handles general graphs and can detect some rather
                 subtle descent. It leads to a worst-case cubic-time
                 approximation of SCT. Experiments confirm the
                 effectiveness and efficiency of the approximations in
                 practice.},

  summary =      "To achieve the termination of offline partial
                 evaluation, it is necessary to ensure that static
                 variables assume boundedly many values during
                 specialization. Various works have addressed the
                 analysis of variable boundedness, in the context of
                 specializing first-order functional programs. The
                 underlying reasoning is always: Observing arbitrarily
                 many increases in a static variable must be impossible,
                 if that would imply observing arbitrarily long
                 sequences of size decreases among some bounded-variable
                 values. Static analysis is used to collect a set of
                 bipartite graphs that describe the parameter
                 dependencies and data size changes observed in possible
                 state transitions of the specializer (operating on the
                 subject program). We capture the reasoning above as a
                 condition on the graphs. This condition is decidable,
                 but complete for PSPACE. We therefore derive a
                 polynomial-time approximation, by considering realistic
                 parameter size-change behaviour.",

Especially important, because of the pervasiveness of the HTTP protovol, is the stateless client-server paradigm, used in the so-called `Common Gateway Interface', or CGI. CGI Programmers must deal with a number of design considerations that are not normally important in conventional programs. The most important are persistence and control of concurrent access. We describee these and other CGI programming considerations, and present a new `little' programming language that was designed specifically as a server-side programming language.}

  semantics allows us to define a language with a rich set of features
  from reusable building blocks, and use program transformation and
  equational reasoning to improve code. Compared to denotational
  semantics, reasoning in monadic style offers the added benefits of
  highly modularized proof and more widely applicable results. To
  demonstrate, we present an axiomatization of environments, and use
  it to prove the correctness of a well-known compilation
  technique. The monadic approach also facilitates generating code in
  various target languages with different sets of built-in features.",

                 logic language to a statically polymorphically typed
                 functional language (FL). The key insight is that
                 polymorphic types can be interpreted as 'need to know'
                 specifications on function arguments. This leads to a
                 criterion for liberally yet safely invoking the FL to
                 reduce application terms as required during unification
                 in the logic language. This method, called
                 P-unification, enriches the capabilities of each
                 language while retaining the integrity of their
                 individual semantics and implementation technologies.
                 The results presented suggest that a Horn clause logic
                 programming (HCLP) systems can utilize unmodified
                 implementations of FL's to: manipulate untyped or
                 dynamically typed data, even though the FL is
                 statically typed; act lazily, even though the FL is
                 strict; and build structures containing HCLP terms
                 alien to the FL, such as unbound variables. (19

  abstract = {
  Phung \emph{et al} (ASIACCS'09) describe a method for wrapping built-in
  methods of JavaScript programs in order to enforce security
  policies. The method is appealing because it requires neither deep
  transformation of the code nor browser modification. Unfortunately
  the implementation outlined suffers from a range of vulnerabilities,
  and policy construction is restrictive and error prone. In this paper we address these issues to provide a systematic way to avoid the identified vulnerabilities, and make it easier for the policy writer to construct declarative
policies -- i.e. policies upon which attacker code has no side effects.

  summary =      "The phrase ``optimal program specialization'' was
                 defined by Jones et al.\@ in 1993 to capture the idea
                 of a specializer being strong enough to remove entire
                 layers of interpretation. As it has become clear that
                 it does not imply ``optimality'' in the everyday
                 meaning of the word, we propose to rename the concept
                 ``Jones-optimality''. \\ We argue that the 1993
                 definition of Jones-optimality is in principle
                 impossible to fulfil for strongly typed languages due
                 to necessary encodings on the inputs and outputs of a
                 well-typed self-interpreter. We propose a technical
                 correction of the definition which allows
                 Jones-optimality to remain a meaningful concept for
                 typed languages. \\ We extend recent work by Hughes and
                 by Taha and Makholm on the long-unsolved problem of
                 Jones-optimal specialization for strongly typed
                 languages. The methods of Taha and Makholm are enhanced
                 to allow ``almost optimal'' results when a
                 self-interpreter is specialized to a type-incorrect
                 program; how to do this has been an open problem since
                 1987. \\ Neither Hughes' nor Taha--Makholm's methods
                 are by themselves sufficient for Jones-optimal
                 specialization when the language contains primitive
                 operations that produce or consume complex data types.
                 A simple postprocess is proposed to solve the problem.
                 \\ An implementation of the proposed techniques has
                 been produced and used for the first successful
                 practical experiments with truly Jones-optimal
                 specialization for strongly typed languages.",

      \begin{quotation}
         Our starting point in this paper is the `Bird-Meertens formalism',
a
      mathematical framework for program transformation currently being
      developed by Richard Bird at Oxford and Lambert Meertens at
Amsterdam.
      The formalism comprises a concise functional notation and a small
      number of remarkably powerful theorems for proving equalities of
      functions. The notation is based on a few elementary operations and
is
      so designed that it lends itself well to the construction of elegant,
      calculational transformations: from the basic operations, one
constructs
      a specification in algorithmic form --- there is no separate
specification
      language --- and transforms the specification into a more efficient
      program. A hallmark of the formalism is that much of this
transformation
      process can be conducted as  a linear, equational proof that the
      original specification is extensionally equal to the resulting more
      efficient version.

ABSTRACT="Of the various approaches to program correctness,
               that of ``Transformational Programming'' appears
               to be the most helpful in constructing correct
               programs. The essence of the method is to start with
               an obviously correct --- but possibly hopelessly
               inefficient --- algorithm, and to improve it by
               successively applying correctness-preserving
                transformations.
               The manipulations involved are akin to those used in
               mathematics. Two important impediments to this method
               are the verbosity of algorithmic notations, making
               the process cumbersome, and the semantic baroqueness
               of many primitives, making it hard to verify the
               validity of transformations. Computer Science can profit
               here from the lessons taught by the history of
               Mathematics. Another major step, comparable to one
               made long ago in Mathematics, is not to insist on the
               ``executability'' of algorithmic descriptions. This
               makes it possible to treat initial high-level
               specifications in the same framework as the final programs.
               Just as Mathematics evolved from ``Transformational
               Arithmetic'', Transformational Programming may come of
               age as ``Algorithmics''."

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a uniform model for programming distributed Web
              applications.  The model is based on the concept of Web
              computation places and provides mechanisms to coordinate
              distributed computations at these places, including peer-to-peer
              communication between places and a uniform mechanism to initiate
              computation in remote places.  Computations can interact with the
              flow of HTTP requests and responses, typically as clients,
              proxies or servers in the Web architecture.  We have implemented
              the model using the global pointers and remote service requests
              provided by the Nexus communication library.  We present the
              model and its rationale, with some illustrative examples, and we
              describe the implementation.}

                 languages with regular languages. The algorithm is
                 based on a simple transformation that applies to any
                 context-free grammar and guarantees that the result can
                 be compiled into a finite automaton. The resulting
                 grammar contains at most one new nonterminal for any
                 nonterminal symbol of the input grammar. The result
                 thus remains readable and if necessary modifiable. We
                 extend the approximation algorithm to the case of
                 weighted context-free grammars. We also report
                 experiments with several grammars showing that the size
                 of the minimal deterministic automata accepting the
                 resulting approximations is of practical use for
                 applications such as speech recognition.",

                 The analysis is exact in the following sense: if the
                 analysis predicts a redex, then there exist a reduction
                 sequence (using standard reduction plus context
                 propagation rules) such that this redex will be
                 reduced. The precision is accomplished using
                 intersection typing. It follows that the analysis is
                 non-elementary recursive --- more surprisingly, the
                 analysis is decidable. We argue that the specification
                 of such an analysis provides a good starting point for
                 developing new flow analyses and an important benchmark
                 against which other flow analyses can be compared.
                 Furthermore, we believe that the methods employed for
                 stating and proving exactness are of independent
                 interest: they provide methods for reasoning about the
                 precision of program analyses.",

  abstract = 	 {We present a constraint system, OF, of feature trees that is appropriate to specify and implement type inference for first-class messages. OF extends traditional systems of feature constraints by a selection constraint x<y>z, ``by first-class feature tree'' y, which is in contrast to the standard selection constraint x[f]y, ``by fixed feature'' f. We investigate the satisfiability problem of OF and show that it can be solved in polynomial time, and even in quadratic time if the number of features is bounded. We compare OF with Treinen's system EF of feature constraints with first-class features, which has an NP-complete satisfiability problem. This comparison yields that the satisfiability problem for OF with negation is NP-hard. We even obtain NP-completeness, for a specific subclass of OF with negation that is useful for a related type inference problem. Based on OF we give a simple account of type inference for first-class messages in the spirit of Nishimura's recent proposal, and we show that it has polynomial time complexity: We also highlight an immediate extension of this type system that is desirable but makes type inference NP-complete.}

                 (possibly in binary form) by an untrusted source. For
                 this to be possible, the untrusted code producer must
                 supply with the code a safety proof that attests to the

                 safe to execute a binary supplied by an untrusted
                 source. The kernel first defines a safety policy and
                 makes it public. Then, using this policy, an
                 application can provide binaries in a special form
                 called proof-carrying code, or simply PCC. Each binary
                 contains, in addition to the native code, a formal
                 proof that the code obeys the safety policy. The kernel
                 can easily validate the proof without using
                 cryptography and without consulting any external
                 trusted entities. If the validation succeeds, the code
                 is guaranteed to respect the safety policy without
                 relying on run-time checks. \par The main practical
                 difficulty of is in generating the safety proofs. In
                 order to gain some preliminary experience with this, we
                 have written several network packet filters in
                 hand-tuned DEC Alpha assembly language, and then
                 generated binaries for them using a special prototype
                 assembler. The binaries can be executed with no
                 run-time overhead, beyond a one-time cost of 1 to 3
                 milliseconds for validating the enclosed proofs. The
                 net result is that our packet filters are formally
                 guaranteed to be safe and are faster than packet
                 filters created using Berkeley Packet Filters, Software
                 Fault Isolation, or safe languages such as Modula-3.",

  summary      = {
The use of the call-by-value continuation passing style (CBV
CPS) translation as a tool in partial evaluation has received much
attention in the literature, but the call-by-name (CBN) CPS
translation does not seem to have been investigated. In this paper, we undertake a
systematic investigation of the effect of CBN CPS in connection with partial
evaluation and deforestation.
First, we give a concrete example of the use of the CBN
CPS translation as a binding time improvement to achieve the effects
of deforestation using standard partial evaluation. The same effect cannot
be achieved with CBV CPS. Second, we prove
formally that the CBN CPS translation in conjunction with partial
evaluation has the power to achieve {\em all\/}
the effects of deforestation. The
consequence of these results is a practical tool (the CBN CPS) for
improving the results of partial evaluation, as well as an
improved understanding of the relation between partial evaluation and deforestation.

                 focussed on applying or extending functional type
                 theory to functional \emph{objects}. This approach,
                 while benefitting from a vast body of existing
                 literature, has the disadvantage of dealing with state
                 change either in a roundabout way or not at all, and
                 completely side-stepping issues of concurrency. In
                 particular, dynamic issues of non-uniform service
                 availability and conformance to protocols are not
                 addressed by functional types. We propose a new type
                 framework that characterizes objects as regular (finite
                 state) processes that provide guarantees of service
                 along public channels. We also propose an original
                 notion of subtyping for regular types that extends
                 Wegner and Zdonik's \emph{principle of substitutability}
                 to non-uniform service availability, and we relate it
                 to known process equivalences. Finally, we formalize
                 what it means to \emph{satisfy a client's expectations},
                 and we show how regular types can be used to tell when
                 sequential or concurrent clients are satisfied. [NB: a
                 revised version is available by ftp.]",

	The programming languages of today are stuck in a

	languages based on rigid, static, closed-world file-based views of

  Church-Rosser property and is a conservative extension of
  classical lambda calculus with respect to operational equivalence;
  that is, all algebraic laws of the functional subset are preserved."

    abstract={Overloading and parametric polymorphism have been combined in an
        extension of ML.  This paper motivates the work by presenting a
        number of illustrative examples including mixed-mode arithmetic,
        linear algebra, and variable-length parameter lists that demonstrate
        the utility and expressiveness of this combination.

        Also shown is how the use of both equality types and weak types
        in the ML type system can be subsumed in the uniform framework of
        overloading polymorphism, the latter by the overloading of reference
        constructors.

        To support several of these examples, the system supports overloading
        with multi-variable type templates for overloaded identifiers.  The
        examples motivate the introduction of {\em liberal resolution},
        a new strategy for resolving overloaded identifiers in a system
        with an ML-like type system.  Uncoupled liberal resolution is
        identified as providing the best trade-off between extensibility
        and useful typing.  A type-checking algorithm is provided that
        supports uncoupled liberal resolution and type checks all of the
        examples in the paper.  The appendix contains a proof of correctness
        for this algorithm.}

  abstract =     "Type-based analysis is an approach to static analysis
                 of programs that has been studied for more than a
                 decade. A typebased analysis assumes that the program
                 type checks, and the analysis takes advantage of that.
                 This paper examines the state of the art of type-based
                 analysis, and it surveys some of the many software
                 tools that use type-based analysis. Most of the
                 surveyed tools use types as discriminators, while most
                 of the theoretical studies use type and eect systems.
                 We conclude that type-based analysis is a promising
                 approach to achieving both provable correctness and
                 good performance with a reasonable eort.",

                  transformations on the program it is compiling in an
                  attempt to improve efficiency. Despite their
                  importance, however, there have been few systematic
                  attempts to categorise such transformations and
                  measure their impact.

                  In this paper we describe a particular group of
                  transformations---the ``let-floating''
                  transformations---and give detailed measurements of
                  their effect in an optimising compiler for the
                  non-strict functional languages
                  Haskell. Let-floating has not received much explicit
                  attention in the past, but our measurements show
                  that it is an improtant group of transformations (at
                  least for lazy languages), offering a reduction of
                  more than {30\%} in heap allocation and {15\%} in
                  execution time."  }

   unification is often tractable in practice, and our translation entails a very useful algorithm for partial type inference in the higher-order
   polymorphic $\lambda$-calculus. We present an implementation in $\lambda$Prolog in full. }

@ARTICLE{Pitts1994,
 AUTHOR={Andrew M. Pitts},
 TITLE={A Co-induction Principle for Recursively Defined Domains},
 JOURNAL={Theoretical Computer Science},
 VOLUME=124,
 YEAR=1994,
 PAGES={195--219},
 NOTE={(A preliminary version of this work appeared as Cambridge Univ.
 Computer Laboratory Tech. Rept. No.~252, April 1992.)},
 ABSTRACT={This paper establishes a new property of predomains recursively
 defined using the cartesian product, disjoint union, partial function
 space and convex powerdomain constructors. We prove that the partial
 order on such a recursive predomain $D$ is the greatest fixed point of
 a certain monotone operator associated to $D$. This provides a
 structurally defined family of proof principles for these recursive
 predomains: to show that one element of $D$ approximates another, it
 suffices to find a binary relation containing the two elements that is
 a post-fixed point for the associated monotone operator. The statement
 of the proof principles is independent of any of the various methods
 available for explicit construction of recursive predomains. Following
 Milner and Tofte, the method of proof is called {\em
 co-induction}. It closely resembles the way bisimulations are used in
 concurrent process calculi.\par
 Two specific instances of the co-induction principle already occur in
 work of Abramsky in the form of `internal full
 abstraction' theorems for denotational semantics of SCCS and the lazy
 lambda calculus. In the first case post-fixed binary relations are
 precisely Abramsky's {\em partial bisimulations}, whereas in the
 second case they are his {\em applicative bisimulations}. The
 co-induction principle also provides an apparently useful tool for
 reasoning about equality of elements of recursively defined datatypes
 in (strict or lazy) higher order functional programming languages.}}

  ABSTRACT = {\emph{Defunctionalization} is a program transformation
                 that eliminates functions as first-class values. We
                 show that defunctionalization can be viewed as a
                 \emph{type-preserving} transformation of an extension
                 of \f with \emph{guarded algebraic data types} into
                 itself. We also suggest that defunctionalization is an
                 instance of \emph{concretization}, a more general
                 technique that allows eliminating constructs other than
                 functions. We illustrate this point by presenting two
                 new type-preserving transformations that can be viewed
                 as instances of concretization. One eliminates
                 R{\'e}my-style polymorphic records; the other eliminates
                 the dictionary records introduced by the standard
                 compilation scheme for Haskell's type classes.}

                 non-interference proof is reasonably light-weight,
                 thanks to the use of a number of orthogonal techniques.
                 First, a syntactic segregation between values and
                 expressions allows a lighter formulation of the type
                 system. Second, non-interference is reduced to subject
                 reduction for a non-standard language extension.
                 Lastly, a semi-syntactic approach to type soundness

  ABSTRACT = {The Java JDK 1.2 Security Architecture includes a dynamic mechanism for
                  enforcing access control checks, so-called \emph{stack inspection}. This paper
                  studies type systems which can statically guarantee the success of these
                  checks.  We develop these systems using a new, systematic methodology: we show
                  that the security-passing style translation, proposed by Wallach and Felten as
                  a \emph{dynamic} implementation technique, also gives rise to \emph{static}
                  security-aware type systems, by composition with conventional type systems.
                  To define the latter, we use the general HM(X) framework, and easily construct
                  several constraint- and unification-based type systems. They offer significant
                  improvements on a previous type system for JDK access control, both in terms
                  of expressiveness and in terms of readability of type specifications.}

                    and Ackerman from the Kahn-McQueen model of processes
                    as relations on streams of data. The reformulation
                    leads directly to a straightforward definition of
                    process composition. Our notion of processes and their
                    composition constitutes a natural generalization of the
                    notion of functions and their composition. We apply
                    this definition of process composition to the
                    development of an algebra of processes, which we
                    propose as supplying a formal semantics for a language
                    whose domain of discourse includes nets of
                    interconnected processes. This in turn leads us to
                    logics of such nets, about which we raise three open
                    and fundamental problems: existence of a finite basis
                    for the operations of the language, finite
                    axiomatizability of the equational theory, and
                    decidability of this theory. A natural generalization

We show that the unification of a linear higher-order pattern s with an arbitrary second-order term that shares no variables with s is decidable and finitary. A few extensions of this unification problem are still decidable\: unifying two second-order terms, where one term is linear, is undecidable if the terms contain bound variables but decidable if they don't. },

Features are similar to (abstract) subclasses, but only    provide the core functionality of a (sub)class. Overwriting other       methods is viewed as resolving feature interactions and is specified    separately for two features at a time. This programming model allows    to compose features (almost) freely in a way which generalizes  inheritance and aggregation. For a set of $n$ features, an      exponential number of different feature combinations is possible,       assuming a quadratic number of interaction resolutions. We present      the feature model as an extension of Java and give two translations to  Java, one via inheritance and the other via aggregation. We further     discuss parameterized features, which work nicely with our feature      model and can be translated into Pizza, an extension of Java.    },

  abstract =     "Many modern languages offer a concept of modules to
                 encapsulate a set of definitions and make some of them
                 visible from outside. Associated to modules are
                 directives ruling importations and exportations as well
                 as controlling other capabilities like renaming or
                 qualified notation. We propose here a language to
                 handle sets of named locations with the aim of
                 describing precisely which locations are to be shared
                 between modules and under which local names they are
                 known. The language is symmetric for imports and
                 exports. It is also extensible since it provides a
                 framework to handle named locations. Mutability, for
                 instance, can readily be expressed thanks to a simple
                 extension of our language. Another more subtle
                 extension is to offer a protocol for modules with
                 ``macros''. Macros allow a user to extend the syntax of
                 a language by providing rewriting rules expressed as
                 computations performed on the representation of
                 programs. Lisp is a language offering macros and much
                 of its extensibility stems from them. However, many
                 problems arise from macros, amongst them being the
                 exact definition of when, where and how the
                 macroexpansion is done to turn the body of a module
                 using extended syntaxes into a regular form in the
                 bare, unextended language. This paper presents, in the
                 framework of Lisp, a definition of modules offering
                 tight control over module environments as well as a
                 precise semantics of separate compilation and
                 macroexpansion. These new (for Lisp) capabilities
                 definitely add some power relative to the management of
                 name spaces but also justify compiling optimizations
                 (inlining, partial evaluation etc.) and, above all,
                 turn Lisp into a language suitable for application
                 delivery since applications are finite collections of
                 modules. Our proposal contributes to a vision of Lisp
                 composed of a multitude of linked and reusable modules.
                 Our results concerning name space management and macros
                 can also be applied to other languages. Two different
                 implementations of these concepts exist: in FEEL, the
                 implementation of EuLisp done by the University of Bath
                 and in the idiom of Icsla, a dialect of Lisp designed
                 at INRIA-Rocquencourt and {\'e}cole Polytechnique. This
                 paper reflects the results of the experiments carried
                 out in these systems during the last year.",

 abstract = {Conventional dataflow analysis computes information about what facts may or will not hold during the execution of a program. Sometimes it is useful, for program optimization, to know how often or with what probability a fact holds true during program execution. In this paper, we provide a precise formulation of this problem for a large class of dataflow problems --- the class of finite bi-distributive subset problems. We show how it can be reduced to a generalization of the standard dataflow analysis problem, one that requires a sum-over-all-paths quantity instead of the usual meet-overall-paths quantity. We show that Kildall's result expressing the meet-over-all-paths value as a maximal-fixed-point carries over to the generalized setting. We then outline ways to adapt the standard dataflow analysis algorithms to solve this generalized problem, both in the intraprocedural and the interprocedural case.},

 TITLE={A Fully Abstract Translation between a $\lambda$-Calculus with
 Reference Types and {Standard} {ML}},
 BOOKTITLE={2nd Int. Conf. on Typed Lambda Calculus and Applications,
 Edinburgh, 1995},
 SERIES=lncs,
 NUMBER=902,
 PUBLISHER=sv,
 YEAR=1995,
 PAGES={397--413},
 ABSTRACT={This paper describes a syntactic translation for a
 substantial fragment of the core Standard ML language into a typed
 lambda calculus with recursive types and imperative features in the
 form of reference types. The translation compiles SML's use of
 declarations and pattern matching into lambda terms, and transforms
 the use of environments in the operational semantics into a simpler
 relation of evaluation to canonical form. The translation is shown to
 be `fully abstract', in the sense that it both preserves and reflects
 observational equivalence (also commonly called contextual
 equivalence). A co-inductively defined notion of applicative
 bisimilarity for lambda calculi with state is developed to establish
 this result.}

                 Polyvariance is achieved by duplication of code; this

                 in practice code explosion is only moderate (factor of
                 less than 10). Does achieve a 1.5 to 2 performance

This paper surveys optimistic replication algorithms that allow replica contents to diverge in the short term, in order to support concurrent work practices and to tolerate failures in low-quality communication links. The importance of such techniques is increasing as collaboration through wide-area and mobile networks becomes popular. Optimistic replication techniques are different from traditional "pessimistic" ones. Instead of synchronous replica coordination, an optimistic algorithm propagates changes in the background, discovers conflicts after they happen and reaches agreement on the final contents incrementally. We explore the solution space for optimistic replication algorithms. This paper identifies key challenges facing optimistic replication systems -- ordering operations, detecting and resolving conflicts, propagating changes efficiently, and bounding replica divergence -- and provides a comprehensive survey of techniques developed for addressing these challenges.},

                 those architectural structures--whether hardware or
                 software--that are necessary to support information
                 protection. The paper develops in three main sections.
                 Section I describes desired functions, design
                 principles, and examples of elementary protection and
                 authentication mechanisms. Any reader familiar with
                 computers should find the first section to be
                 reasonably accessible. Section II requires some
                 familiarity with descriptor-based computer
                 architecture. It examines in depth the principles of
                 modern protection architectures and the relation
                 between capability systems and access control list
                 systems, and ends with a brief analysis of protected
                 subsystems and protected objects. The reader who is
                 dismayed by either the prerequisites or the level of
                 detail in the second section may wish to skip to
                 Section III, which reviews the state of the art and

  abstract =     "Object-oriented programming facilitates the
                 development of generic software, but at a cost in terms
                 of performance of the final program. We use partial
                 evaluation to automatically map generic objectoriented
                 software into specific implementations. In this paper
                 we give a concise and formalized description of how
                 partial evaluation specializes an object-oriented
                 program.

                 1 Introduction

                 The object-oriented style of
                 programming naturally leads to the development of
                 generic program components. Encapsulation of data and
                 code into objects enhances code resilience to program
                 modifications and improves the possibilities for direct
                 code reuse. Message passing between objects in the form
                 of virtual dispatches lets program components
                 communicate without relying on a specific
                 implementation; this decoupling enables dynamic
                 modification of the program structure to react to
                 changing conditions. Genericity implemented using these
                 language features is however achieved at the expense of
                 efficiency....",

  abstract =     "Inline function expansion is an optimization that may
                 improve program performance by removing calling
                 sequences and enlarging the scope of other
                 optimizations. Unfortunately it also has the drawback
                 of enlarging programs. This might impair executable
                 programs performance. In order to get rid of this
                 annoying effect, we present in this paper an easy to
                 implement inlining optimization that minimizes code
                 size growth by combining a compile-time algorithm
                 deciding {\em when} expansion should occur with
                 different expansion frameworks describing {\em how}
                 they should be performed. We present the experimental
                 measures that have driven the design of inline function
                 expansion. We conclude with measurements showing that
                 our optimization succeeds in producing faster codes
                 while avoiding code size increase.",

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a new type system tracing
    information flow for a $\lambda$-calculus equipped with
    polymorphic ``let'' and with sums (a.k.a.\ union types or
    polymorphic variants).  The type system allows establishing (weak)
    non-interference properties.  Thanks to original forms of security
    annotations and constraints, it is more accurate than existing
    analyses.  Through a straightforward encoding into sums, this work
    also provides a new type-based information flow analysis for
    programming languages featuring exceptions.  From these systems,
    one may derive constraint-based formulations, in the style of
    HM(X), which have decidable type inference.}

		  soundness for the framework, treating an extended version of the

              primitive sets and associated operations.  The language
              is equipped with a precise type discipline that
              statically captures dynamic properties of sets, allowing
              runtime optimizations.  We demonstrate the utility of
              $\mathrm{pml}_B$ by showing how it can serve as a practical
              \emph{implementation} language for higher-level
              programming language based security systems, and
              characterize $\mathrm{pml}_B$ by comparing the expressiveness of
              $\mathrm{pml}_B$ sets with enumerations.}

                   very simple functional programming language gives rise to
                   a plethora of semantic questions.  These questions are not
                   only concerned with the choice operator itself.  A
                   surprisingly large number of different parameter passing
                   mechanisms are made possible by the introduction of bounded
                   non-determinism.  The diversity of semantic possibilities
                   is examined systematically using denotational definitions
                   based on mathematical structures called powerdomains.  This
                   results in an improved understanding of the different kinds
                   of non-determinism and the properties of different kinds of
                   non-deterministic languages.  },

  type system framework for Hindley/Milner style systems
  such as checking for consistency of programs
  involving physical units, various overloading systems and
  enforcing certain security policies.
  Individual instances of our type system framework can be obtained by providing an appropriate
  domain of types  and constraints. The novelty of our approach is that properties of
  constraints can be described
  by Constraint Handling Rules (CHRs). As we will show, this makes it easy to design
  new type systems in a concise way.

  On the practical side, we have implemented the CHR-based type inference algorithm
  in the functional language Haskell including a simple user interface.
  This shows that our approach is not only of theoretical interest, but also represents an important
  tool for the designer of Hindley/Milner style type systems.},

                  for a higher-order, functional language from an appropriate
                  interpreter using a state-of-the-art offline partial evaluator.
                  To ensure termination of the generated online specializer the
                  interpreter computes a self-embedding property on closure values
                  and data structures. This guarantees termination whenever there
                  is no static loop in the program to be specialized. We obtain
 a
                  transformer for higher-order removal and higher-order arity
                  raising (redundancy elimination) for free, by running the online

                 depends on the accuracy of the positional information
                 that is associated with type errors. We present an
                 approach where the location associated with an error
                 message {\em e\/} is defined as a {\em slice\/} {\em P
                 e\/} of the program {\em P\/} being type-checked. We
                 show that this approach yields highly accurate
                 positional information: {\em P e\/} is a program that
                 contains precisely those program constructs in {\em
                 P\/} that caused error {\em e}. Semantically, we have
                 the interesting property that type-checking {\em P e\/}
                 is guaranteed to produce the same error {\em e}. Our
                 approach is completely language-independent and has
                 been implemented for a significant subset of Pascal. We
                 also report on experiments with object-oriented type
                 systems, and with a subset of ML.",

  abstract = 	 {Feature Constraint Systems have been proposed as a logical data structure for constraint (logic) programming. They provide a record-like view to trees by identifying subtrees by keyword rather than by position. Their atomic constraints are finer grained than in the constructor-based approach. The recently proposed CFT [Smolka&Treinen94] in fact generalizes the rational tree system of Prolog II.

We propose a new feature constraint system EF which extends CFT by considering features as first class values. As a consequence, EF contains constraints like x[v]w where v is a variable ranging over features, while CFT restricts v to be a fixed feature symbol.

We show that the satisfiability of conjunctions of atomic EF-constraints is NP-complete. Satisfiability of quantifier-free EF-constraints is shown to be decidable, while the $\exists^*\forall^*\exists^*$ fragment of the first order theory is undecidable. }

                Traditionally, abstraction is achieved by refusing to
                export the representation. With views, abstraction can be
                achieved by exporting as many representations as required.

             The two are important concepts; this paper presents
             a mechanism --- an isomorphism
             between the representation and the abstraction of a data type ---
             allowing both at the same time.

  abstract =     "One way to provide fault isolation among cooperating
                 software modules is to place each in its own address
                 space. However, for tightly-coupled modules, this
                 solution incurs prohibitive context switch overhead. In
                 this paper, we present a software approach to
                 implementing fault isolation within a single address
                 space. Our approach has two parts. First, we load the
                 code and data for a distrusted module into its own
                 fault domain, a logically separate portion of the
                 application's address space. Second, we modify the
                 object code of a distrusted module to prevent it from
                 writing or jumping to an address outside its fault
                 domain. Both these software operations are portable and
                 programming language independent. \par Our approach
                 poses a tradeoff relative to hardware fault isolation:
                 substantially faster communication between fault
                 domains, at a cost of slightly increased execution time
                 for distrusted modules. We demonstrate that for
                 frequently communicating modules, implementing fault
                 isolation in software rather than hardware can
                 substantially improve end-to-end application
                 performance.",

  title = 	 {Understanding {Java} Stack Inspection},
  crossref = 	 {ieeessp1998},
  year =	 1998,
  abstract = 	 {Current implementations of Java make security decisions by searching the runtime call stack. These systems
                 have attractive security properties, but they have been criticized as being dependent on specific artifacts of
                 the Java implementation.

                 This paper models the stack inspection algorithm in terms of a well-understood logic for access control and
                 demonstrates how stack inspection is a useful tool for expressing and managing complex trust relationships.
                 We show that an access control decision based on stack inspection corresponds to the construction of a
                 proof in the logic, and we present an efficient decision procedure for generating these proofs.

                 By examining the decision procedure, we demonstrate that many statements in the logic are equivalent and
                 can thus be expressed in a simpler form. We show that there are a finite number of such statements,
                 allowing us to represent the security state of the system as a pushdown automaton. We also show that this
                 automaton may be embedded in Java by rewriting all Java classes to pass an additional argument when a
                 procedure is invoked. We call this security-passing style and describe its benefits over previous stack
                 inspection systems. Finally, we show how the logic allows us to describe a straightforward design for
                 extending stack inspection across remote procedure calls.

    variable at run time.  With this facility, we can write a function
    to convert a term from one abstract type to another, if the two
    hidden types are identical.  However, the naive implementation of
    this function requires that the term be destructed and rebuilt. In
    this paper, we show how to eliminate this overhead using
    higher-order type abstraction. We demonstrate this solution in two

  ABSTRACT = {Languages for intensional type analysis permit ad-hoc
     polymorphism, or run-time analysis of types. However, such
     languages require complex, specialized constructs to support this
     operation, which hinder optimization and complicate the
     meta-theory of these languages. In this paper, we observe that
     such specialized operators need not be intrinsic to the language,
     and in fact, their operation may be simulated through standard
     encodings of iteration in the polymorphic lambda
     calculus. Therefore, we may more easily add intensional analysis
     operators to complicated languages via a translation semantics,
     instead of through language extension.}

                  has been implemented.
                  In the situation where a Hol user would normally employ the
                  built-in function GEN\_REWRITE\_CONV, a function that directly
                  produces a conversion of the desired functionality, this
                  article demonstrates how producing the conversion in the
                  form of a program text instead of as a closure can lead
                  to significant speed-ups.
                  The Hol system uses a set of 31 simplifying equations on a
                  very large number of intermediate terms derived, e.g.,
                  during backwards proofs.  For this set the conversion
                  generated by the two-step method is about twice as fast as
                  the method currently used.  When installing the new
                  conversion, tests show that the overall running times of Hol
                  proofs are reduced by about~10\%.  Apart from the speed-up
                  this is completely invisible to the user.  With cooperation
                  from the user further speed-up is possible.},

  ABSTRACT = {Let $S$ be some type system.  A \emph{typing} in $S$
                  for a typable term $M$ is the collection of all of
                  the information other than $M$ which appears in the
                  final judgement of a proof derivation showing that
                  $M$ is typable.  For example, suppose there is a
                  derivation in $S$ ending with the judgement
                  $A\vdash{M}\mathrel{:}{\tau}$ meaning that $M$ has
                  result type $\tau$ when assuming the types of free
                  variables are given by $A$.  Then $(A,\tau)$ is a
                  typing for $M$.
                  \par
                  A \emph{principal typing} in $S$ for a term $M$ is a
                  typing for $M$ which somehow represents all other
                  possible typings in $S$ for $M$.  It is important not
                  to confuse this notion with the weaker notion of
                  \emph{principal type} often mentioned in connection
                  with the Hindley/Milner type system.  Previous
                  definitions of principal typings for specific type
                  systems have involved various syntactic operations
                  on typings such as \emph{substitution} of types for
                  type variables, \emph{expansion}, \emph{lifting},
                  etc.
                  \par
                  This paper presents a new general definition of
                  principal typings which does not depend on the
                  details of any particular type system.  This paper
                  shows that the new general definition correctly
                  generalizes previous system-dependent definitions.
                  This paper explains why the new definition is the
                  right one.  Furthermore, the new definition is used
                  to prove that certain polymorphic type systems using
                  $\forall$-quantifiers, namely System F and the
                  Hindley/Milner system, do not have principal
                  typings.}

rewriting techniques for the specification of the language semantics.
The approach easily extends from polymorphic functional languages to
imperative languages that provide references, exceptions,
continuations, and similar features.  We illustrate the technique with
a type soundness theorem for the core of Standard ML, which includes
the first type soundness proof for polymorphic exceptions and
continuations.},

The framework Pure Type System (PTS) offers a simple and general
approach to designing and formalizing type systems. However, in the
presence of dependent types, there often exist some acute problems that
make it difficult for PTS to accommodate many common realistic
programming features such as general recursion, recursive types, effects
(e.g., exceptions, references, input/output), etc. In this paper, we
propose a new framework Applied Type System (ATS) to allow for designing
and formalizing type systems that can readily support common realistic
programming features. The key salient feature of ATS lies in a complete
separation between statics, in which types are formed and reasoned about,
and dynamics, in which programs are constructed and evaluated. With this
separation, it is no longer possible for a program to occur in a type as is
otherwise allowed in PTS.  We present not only a formal development of
ATS but also mention some examples in support of using ATS as a
framework to form type systems for practical programming.

abstract = {{
We introduce a notion of guarded recursive (g.r.) datatype constructors,
generalizing the notion of recursive datatypes in functional programming
languages such as ML and Haskell. We address both theoretical and practical
issues resulted from this generalization. On one hand, we design a type
system to formalize the notion of g.r. datatype constructors and then prove
the soundness of the type system. On the other hand, we present some
significant applications (e.g., implementing objects, implementing staged
computation, etc.) of g.r. datatype constructors, arguing that
g.r. datatype constructors can have far-reaching consequences in
programming.  The main contribution of the paper lies in the recognition
and then the formalization of a programming notion that is of both
theoretical interest and practical use.
