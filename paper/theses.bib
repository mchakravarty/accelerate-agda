                 application of a partial evaluation procedure for
                 rewriting-based functional logic programs. Functional
                 logic programming languages unite the two main
                 declarative programming paradigms. The rewriting-based
                 computational model extends traditional functional
                 programming languages by incorporating logical
                 features, including logical variables and built-in
                 search, into its framework. This work is the first to
                 address the automatic specialisation of these
                 functional logic programs. In particular, a theoretical
                 framework for the partial evaluation of rewriting-based
                 functional logic programs is defined and its
                 correctness is established. Then, an algorithm is
                 formalised which incorporates the theoretical framework
                 for the procedure in a fully automatic technique.
                 Constraint solving is used to represent additional
                 information about the terms encountered during the
                 transformation in order to improve the efficiency and
                 size of the residual programs. Experiments using an
                 implementation of the algorithm for the partial
                 evaluation of Escher programs show that the specialiser
                 not only passes the ``KMP-test'', but also can perform
                 the elimination of data structures and obtains notable
                 speed-up for McCarthy's 91-function. Circuit simulation
                 lends itself to optimisation by partial evaluation. A
                 general interpreted-code circuit simulator can be
                 specialised with respect to a particular design in
                 order to improve the simulation speed. In this work, a
                 simulator is implemented for behavioural and
                 register-transfer level designs written in the Verilog
                 hardware description language. Testing and verification
                 of high-level designs using interpreted-code simulators
                 is notoriously inefficient. In this thesis, it is shown
                 that the efficiency of an event-driven simulator for
                 behavioural or register-transfer level designs can be
                 improved automatically by partial evaluation.",

  abstract = {This book presents a modular framework for slicing in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL which is based on abstract control flow graphs. Building on such abstract structures renders the correctness results language-independent. To prove that they hold for a specific language, it remains to instantiate the framework with this language, which requires a formal semantics of this language in Isabelle/HOL. We show that formal semantics even for sophisticated high-level languages are realizable.},
